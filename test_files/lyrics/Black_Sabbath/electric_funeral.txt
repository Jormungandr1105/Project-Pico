Reflex in the sky
Warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you better hide
From the atomic tide

Flashes in the sky
Turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay
Radiation minds decay

Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon

Dying world of radiation
Victims of man's frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

Buildings crashing down
To earth's cracking ground
Rivers turned to mud
Eyes melt into blood

Earth lies in deathbed
Clouds cry for the dead
Tearing falling rain
Ease the burning pain

Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral
Electric Funeral

And so in the sky
Shines the electric eye
Supernatural king
Takes Earth under his wing

Heaven's golden chorus sings
Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to hell
Ever trapped in burning cell
