Meet me glassy eyed, blind, and divine
Under a void on the ghost land
The castle is a pimple on the face of the world
The embers burned for ghouls to tread if youâ€™d please try

I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

We pray for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all of our holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle

The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out the
Fall of the end of the world if that were
crumble down

In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
When my walls are safe from world weather
The build forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be visible
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

On this very day, in one thousand
Years the earth will be relative to the
Sun and the moon and a new world will be
Created, I know because it is written here

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
