Join me at the table if you'd like to place a bet
All the cash that's filling your pockets is waiting to be spent
I know you've never played but drinks are free, its so bizarre
Even if you lose a few chips, it's cheaper than the bar

Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

The king extends his head, he looks into my palm
I don't know if he wants to shake it or cut it from my arm
The dealer sits a-washing all the burned cards from the deck
I think he might be trying to clean them, but I'd have to double check

Beginner's luck is on your side
You've got dollar signs inside your eyes

The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

All your money's scared and you're down to betting skins
But have you heard of a trick called spooking? It'll help you win
But tricks are just for children and cheating is a sin
And now you're down to the felt on the table and security's moving in

Beginner's luck of course backfired
Caught red-handed by the eye in the sky

The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough

The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
The beginner's luck, now don't mess it up
If you get too stuck just bluff
The beginner's luck is tough
